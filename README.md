🚀 Advanced DSA & System Design – Scaler Course Project

 📖 Overview
This repository is a structured learning hub for mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and System Design concepts. It is designed to help software engineers dive deep into:
- Optimized solutions for complex DSA problems
- Low-Level Design (LLD) principles with clean, maintainable code
- High-Level Design (HLD) strategies for scalable, distributed systems

 🎯 Learning Objectives
- DSA Mastery: Explore advanced topics like dynamic programming, graph algorithms, tries, segment trees, and optimization tricks.
- LLD (Low-Level Design): Learn object-oriented design, SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean coding practices.
- HLD (High-Level Design): Understand scalability, fault tolerance, caching, load balancing, and distributed system components.
- Optimized Solutions: Focus on time and space complexity analysis, trade-offs, and best practices.

 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Languages: Java 8
- Frameworks: Spring Boot
- Databases: MySQL

 🌟 Highlights
- Deep dive into optimized DSA solutions with clear explanations.
- Practical LLD implementations showcasing design patterns.
- Real-world HLD case studies (e.g., designing scalable chat apps, e-commerce platforms, payment systems).
- Well-documented notes and references for quick revision.


Would you like me to also create a shorter, recruiter-friendly project description (2–3 lines) that you can paste into your GitHub profile or resume, so it looks crisp and impactful?
