SOLID Principles
S - Single Responsibility Principle
=> Every code unit should have only one responsibility
=> There should be only one reason to change the code
Identify => Monster method -> a method does more than what its name suggests.
    A method with mutiple if-else is likely to violate the SRP

O - Open-close Principle
=> Codebase should be open for extension and close for modification

L - LisKov's Substitution Principle
=> An Object Child classes should be substituable  as it is in the parent class data type,without any change
=> child class should not change the meaning of a method which it is overriding.
=> child class should behave as the parent class wants them to writing code to the parent class

I - Interface-Segregation Principle
=>Interface should be light as possible, has less method.
=> ideal number of methods for the interface should be one like functional interface

D - Dependency inversion Principle
=>


Creational Design Pattern
1. Singleton DP
2. Builder DP => if class has too many attributes, then it should create object with different attributes by using builder inner class to build object
3. Prototype & Registery DP => to make clone and register different type of objects
4. Factory DP => create object while using abstract factory to avoid dependency of one class in other class

Structural Design Pattern
1. Adapter DP => acts as adapter between two components
2. Facade DP => divide the responsibility of class,if that class hold too much responsibility
3. Decorator DP => Decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class.
4. FlyWeight DP => If object is taking more memory than u can store intrinsic(value is same everytime) and extrinsic(value changes everytime) properties
    separately.

Behaviourly Design Pattern
1. Strategy DP => whenever we have mutiple ways to do something use strategy DP example : GOogle find path
2. Observer DP => Whenever there is to notify other component use Observer DP example: Notification,Subscribtion
